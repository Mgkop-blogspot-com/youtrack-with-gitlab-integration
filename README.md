### Integration steps

1. Gitlab:
    - Create web hook on **Merge request events** with **secret token** and chosen **url**

- `cargo build`
- `systemfd --no-pid -s http::3000 -- cargo watch -x run`
- `RUSTFLAGS=-Awarnings systemfd --no-pid -s http::3000 -- cargo watch -x run`
- ` cargo build 2>&1 | rg -i --multiline "(^error.*\n.*)|(aborting)|(warnings)"`

### What is done

- Youtrack sdk
    - [X] Issue reading
    - [X] Issue status changing
    - [ ] Comment adding with link to the gitlab
    - [ ] Endpoint on status changing
- Gitlab:
    - [ ] Checking of merge requests creation
    - [ ] Checking merging of tasks
    - [ ] Endpoint for webhooks events (pipeline finishing, merge, comments):
        - [ ] endpoint (check token, parse request, do some work on the youtrack)
        - [X] Deserialization for web hooks
- Common:
    - [ ] On Merging should check. If pipline not finished:
        - [ ] set label "Pipeline in progress"
        - [ ] remove label when pipeline will be done
    - [ ] If was added comment to the merge request, then task should be labeled with "review comments"
